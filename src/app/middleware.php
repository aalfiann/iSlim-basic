     * Default reSlim is not provide any middleware 
     *
     * Any example authentication in reSlim is using basic authentication with database to store the registered token,
     * but even still using basic, it doesn't lose You to support secure login in mobile device or any device with rest api way
     *
     * For advanced user in PSR, I recommend you to use authentication in middleware like using JWT or oAuth2, 
     * because it highly secure and very support for large scale development.
     *
     * Then just put your middleware here ...
